# pycalc
This is virtually the same as my other repo called [cppcalc](https://github.com/lilHummingbird/cppcalc) and will do the same job.

This project is mostly to prove to myself i still know python and can work with it without problems.

Short and sweet, had virtually no issues.

Project complete <3
